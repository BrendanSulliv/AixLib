ERROR: Failed to solve nonlinear system using Newton solver.
  During initialization at time: 0
  Tag: simulation.nonlinear[1]

  Common causes:
   * The system of equations has no solution - the residual will be above zero.
     - This may be caused by initial conditions not being fully specified, check the translation log.
     - In some cases the event-logic can cause this.
   * Starting values are too far from the solution, see homotopy in the manual.
     - In rare cases this could occur at events.
   * The equations are too discontinuous for the nonlinear solver - the residual will have knees.
     - Likely caused by over-using noEvent.
  Especially consider the first two items above when the nonlinear solver fails during initialization.

  To get more information consider the options:
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/Generate listing of translated Modelica code in dsmodel.mof
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/List non-linear iteration variables
   * Simulation/Setup/Debug/Store variables after failed initialization
     - If a failure to solve a nonlinear equation caused failed initialization.
   * The options under the group Simulation/Setup/Debug/Nonlinear solver diagnostics

  Jacobian inverse norm estimate: 149507
  Condition number estimate: 1
  1-norm of the residual = 1.6965E-013
  The estimates indicate that the Jacobian is close to singular, suggesting that there is no solution.
   - Especially since the norm of the last residual vector is small.

  Last value of the solution:
    boundary1.ports[1].m_flow = 4.11885E-007
  Last value of the residual:
    { 1.6965E-013 }
