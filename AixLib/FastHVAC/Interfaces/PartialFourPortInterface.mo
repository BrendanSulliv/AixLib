<p>
This component defines the interface for models that
transport two fluid streams between four ports.
It is similar to
<a href=\"modelica://AixLib.Fluid.Interfaces.PartialTwoPortInterface\">
AixLib.Fluid.Interfaces.PartialTwoPortInterface</a>,
but it has four ports instead of two.
</p>
<p>
The model is used by other models in this package that add heat transfer,
mass transfer and pressure drop equations.

November 3, 2016, by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Moved computation of pressure drop to variable assignment so that
the model won't mix graphical with textual modeling if used as a base
class for a graphically implemented model.
</li>
<li>
November 3, 2016, by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Removed start values for mass flow rate and pressure difference
to simplify the parameter window.<br/>
This is for
<a href=\"https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa/issues/552\">#552</a>.
</li>
<li>
January 22, 2016, by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Corrected type declaration of pressure difference.
This is
for <a href=\"https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa/issues/404\">#404</a>.

Removed assignment of <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
attributes of port mass flow rates, as this is already
done in the base class.
</li>
<li>
November 12, 2013 by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Removed <code>import Modelica.Constants;</code> statement.
</li>
<li>
November 11, 2013 by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Removed the parameter <code>homotopyInitialization</code>
as it is no longer used in this model.
</li>
<li>
November 10, 2013 by Michael Wetter:<br/>
In the computation of <code>sta_a1</code>,
<code>sta_a2</code>, <code>sta_b1</code> and <code>sta_b2</code>,
removed the branch that uses the homotopy operator.
The rational is that these variables are conditionally enables (because
of <code>... if show_T</code>). Therefore, the Modelica Language Specification
does not allow for these variables to be used in any equation. Hence,
the use of the homotopy operator is not needed here.
</li>
<li>
October 10, 2013 by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Added <code>noEvent</code> to the computation of the states at the port.
This is correct, because the states are only used for reporting, but not
to compute any other variable.
Use of the states to compute other variables would violate the Modelica
language, as conditionally removed variables must not be used in any equation.
</li>
<li>
October 8, 2013 by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Removed the computation of <code>V_flow</code> and removed the parameter
<code>show_V_flow</code>.
The reason is that the computation of <code>V_flow</code> required
the use of <code>sta_a</code> (to compute the density),
but <code>sta_a</code> is also a variable that is conditionally
enabled. However, this was not correct Modelica syntax as conditional variables
can only be used in a <code>connect</code>
statement, not in an assignment. Dymola 2014 FD01 beta3 is checking
for this incorrect syntax. Hence, <code>V_flow</code> was removed as its
conditional implementation would require a rather cumbersome implementation
that uses a new connector that carries the state of the medium.

<li>
April 26, 2013 by Marco Bonvini:<br/>
Moved the definitions of <code>dp1</code> and <code>dp2</code> because they cause some problem with PyFMI.
</li>
<li>
March 27, 2012 by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Replaced the erroneous function call <code>Medium.density</code> with
<code>Medium1.density</code> and <code>Medium2.density</code>.
Changed condition to remove <code>sta_a1</code> and <code>sta_a2</code> to also
compute the states at the inlet port if <code>show_V_flow=true</code>.
The previous implementation resulted in a translation error
if <code>show_V_flow=true</code>, but worked correctly otherwise
because the erroneous function call is removed if  <code>show_V_flow=false</code>.
</li>
<li>
March 27, 2011 by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Added <code>homotopy</code> operator.
</li>
<li>
March 21, 2010 by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Changed pressure start value from <code>system.p_start</code>
to <code>Medium.p_default</code> since HVAC models may have water and
air, which are typically at different pressures.
</li>
<li>
September 19, 2008 by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Added equations for the mass balance of extra species flow,
i.e., <code>C</code> and <code>mC_flow</code>.
</li>
<li>
April 28, 2008, by Michael Wetter:<br/>
First implementation.
