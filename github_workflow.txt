Git Workflow:

1.	Create Fork of the repo Aixlib (Fork of single Branch is not possible)
2.	Clone Branch "issue309_fastHvac" from Fork to local computer (git clone ...)
3.	Fix problems while keeping files synced (see below)
4.	Stage fixed files (git add ...)
5.	Commit files to own fork (git commit)
6.	Push files to server (git push origin issue309_fastHvac)
7.	Make pull request (go to github original repo site, pull request, base fork: Original, head fork: own version)



Keeping fork synced:

1.	Add upstream (original from that we forked) remote (git remote add upstream "URL")
2.	fetch branches (git fetch upstream)
3.	change working directory (git checkout issue309_fastHvac)
4.	sync (merge) fork with upstream branch: git merge upstream /issue309_fastHvac
